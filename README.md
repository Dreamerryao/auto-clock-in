# 🛠️ Alkanes Auto Check-in Script by [@OOP](https://x.com/__ababa___)

## 📌 Description

This is a **completely free and open-source** auto check-in script for **Alkanes2:21568**, designed for both **SegWit wallets (starting with bc1q)** and **Taproot wallets (starting with bc1p)**.
The script supports four transaction modes and can automatically construct transactions based on your configured starting fee rate, including **automatic RBF (Replace-By-Fee) resubmission**.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Copy the `config.yaml.example` file and rename it to `config.yaml`.
2. Fill in the following fields in config.yaml:
	•	Your mnemonic phrase list
	•	The starting fee rate (must be ≥ 3, in sat/vByte)
	•	The maximum fee rate you are willing to pay for this check-in (usually around 20, i.e., 3-4 USD)
3. Ensure your SegWit (`bc1q...`) or Taproot (`bc1p...`) address has a sufficient balance (recommended: ~$20 USD) to cover transaction fees.
